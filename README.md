# Let's explore the Met!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionalities of this app:

- Search for your favorite artpieces from the Met\
- See their images / date / title\
- Filter the artpieces by:\
    - art piece finished date\
    - if image can be loaded\
    - alphabetically\

## Limits of this app:

- Search may take a while if the search term entered is broad. However, rest assured that recently searched items will load much faster!\
- The UI of the art grid is in progress. Feedback welcome!
